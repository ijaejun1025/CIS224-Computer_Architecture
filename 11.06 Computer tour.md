# 11.06 Computer tour 

The term computer has changed meaning over the years.   
The term originally referred to a person that performed computations by hand.   
* 1940s/1950s -> Large machines like in the earlier photo   
* 1970s/1980s -> Small home computers like personal computers or PCs and portable/laptop computers     
* 2000s/2010s -> Other computing devices like pads, book readers, and smart phones   
* Nowdays -> The term computer even refers to computing devices embedded inside other electronic devices.   

In the early days of computing, the physical equipment was prone to failures.   
As programs became larger, the term **software** became popular to distinguish a computer's programs from the **hardware**.    

## Computer components 
![Computer](https://github.com/ijaejun1025/CIS224-Computer_Architecture/assets/154036705/985dc8db-89d1-4788-9058-881994fec0ad)     
A computer typically consists of several components    

* **Input/output devices**   
  * A **screen** displays itmes to a user. Today's computers display textual items and graphical items. **(Input)**   
  * A **keyboard** allows a user to provide input to the computer. **(Output)**   
  * A **Mouse** displays graphical items to a user. **(Input)**   
  * Keyboards and mice are increasingly being replaced by **touchscreens. (Input/Output)**   
  * Other devices provide input and output means, such as **microphones, speakers, printers, and USB interfaces.**   

* **Storage**
  * A **disk** stores files and other data.   
  * Disks are non-volatile, meaning they maintain their contents even when powered off.   
  * The disk spins under a head that pulses electricity at just the right times to orient specific particles.   

* **Memory**
  * **RAM (random-access memory)** temporarily holds data read from storage.   
  * It is designed such that any address can be accessed much faster than disk.   
  * The **"random access"** term comes from being able to access any memory location quickly.   
  * RAM is volatile, losing its contents when powered off.   
  * Memory size is typically listed in **bits or in bytes**, where a byte is 8 bits.   

* **Processor**
  * The **processor** runs the computer's programs, reading and executing instructions from memory, performing operations, and reading/writing data from/to memory.
  * When powered on, the processor executes the program whose first instruction is at memory location 0.
  * That program is the **BIOS (basic input/output system)**, which sets up the computer's basic peripherals.
  * The processor then begins executing a program called an **OS (operating system)**.
  * The **operating system** allows a user to run other programs and interfaces with the many other peripherals.
  * Processors are also called **CPUs (central processing units)**.
  * Processor may contain a small amount of RAM on its own chip, called **cache memory**.

* **Clock**
  * A processor's instructions execute at a rate governed by the processor's **clock**.
  * Processors have clocks that tick at rates such as 1 MHz (1 million ticks/second) for an inexpensive processor.
  * Processors have clocks that tick at rates such as 1 GHz (1 billion ticks/second) for costlier processors.
  * Executing about 1 instruction per clock tick, processors thus execute many instructions per second.

After computers were invented and occupied entire rooms, engineers created smaller switches called **transistors**.   
In 1958, it was integrated onto a single chip called an **integrated circuit**.   
Engineers continued to make transistors smaller, leading to **Moore's Law**.

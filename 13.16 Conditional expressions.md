# 13.16 Conditional expressions

If-else statements with the form shown below are so common that the language supports the **shorthand** notation shown.

A **conditional expression** has the form condition ? exprWhenTrue : exprWhenFalse.   

All three operands are expressions.   
If the condition evaluates to true, then exprWhenTrue is evaluated.    
If the condition evaluates to false, then exprWhenFalse is evaluated.    
The conditional expression evaluates to whichever of those two expressions was evaluated.   
For example, if x is 2, then the conditional expression (x == 2) ? 5 : 9 * x evaluates to 5.   

A conditional expression has three operands and thus the **"?" and ":"** together are sometimes referred to as a **ternary operator**.   

```c
// if-else statement
if (x > 50) {
   y = 50;
}
else {
   y = x;
}

// single statement
y = (x > 50) ? 50 : x;
```

```c
// if-else statement
if (x < 20) {
  y = x;
}
else {
  y = 20;
}

// single statement
y = (x < 20) ? x : 20;
```

## Conditional expression: Print negative or positive
Create a conditional expression that evaluates to string "negative" if userVal is less than 0, and "non-negative" otherwise.   
Ex) If userVal is -9, output is: -9 is negative.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
   char condStr[50];
   int userVal;

   scanf("%d", &userVal);

   strcpy(condStr, (userVal < 0) ? "negative" : "non-negative");

   printf("%d is %s.\n", userVal, condStr);

   return 0;
}
```

## Conditional assignment
Using a conditional expression, write a statement that increments numUsers if updateDirection is 1, otherwise decrements numUsers.   
Ex) if numUsers is 8 and updateDirection is 1, numUsers becomes 9; if updateDirection is 0, numUsers becomes 7.   

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int numUsers;
   int updateDirection;

   scanf("%d", &numUsers);
   scanf("%d", &updateDirection);

   numUsers = (updateDirection == 1) ? numUsers+1 : numUsers-1;

   printf("New value is: %d\n", numUsers);

   return 0;
}
```

# 12.04 Arithmetic expressions (general)

## Basics
An **expression** is any individual item or combination of items.   
A common place where expressions are used is on the right side of an assignment statement.   
Ex) y = <ins>2 * (x + 1)</ins> -> **expression**   

A literal is a specific value in code like 2.   
Ex) y = <ins>2</ins> * (x + 1) -> **literal**   

An **operator** is a symbol that performs a built-in calculation, like +, which performs addition.   
Ex) y = 2 * (x <ins>+</ins> 1) -> **operator** 

|Arithmetic operator|Description|
|------|----|
|+|	The **addition** operator is +, as in x + y.|
|-|The **subtraction** operator is -, as in x - y. Also, the - operator is for **negation**, as in -x + y, or x + -y.|
|*|The **multiplication** operator is *, as in x * y.|
|/|The **division** operator is /, as in x / y.|

# 12.04 Arithmetic expressions (general)

## Basics
An **expression** is any individual item or combination of items.   
A common place where expressions are used is on the right side of an assignment statement.   
Ex) y = <ins>2 * (x + 1)</ins> -> **expression**   

A **literal** is a specific value in code like 2.   
Ex) y = <ins>2</ins> * (x + 1) -> **literal**   

An **operator** is a symbol that performs a built-in calculation, like +, which performs addition.   
Ex) y = 2 * (x <ins>+</ins> 1) -> **operator** 

|Arithmetic operator|Description|
|------|----|
|+|	The **addition** operator is +, as in x + y.|
|-|The **subtraction** operator is -, as in x - y. Also, the - operator is for **negation**, as in -x + y, or x + -y.|
|*|The **multiplication** operator is *, as in x * y.|
|/|The **division** operator is /, as in x / y.|

## Evaluation of expressions
An expression **evaluates** to a value, which replaces the expression.   
Ex) If x is 5, then x + 1 evaluates to 6, and y = x + 1 assigns y with 6.   
An expression is evaluated using the order of standard mathematics, **precedence rules**.   
|Operator/Convention|Description|Explanation|
|------|----|----|
|**( )**|Items within parentheses are evaluated first|In 2 * (x + 1), the x + 1 is evaluated first, with the result then multiplied by 2.|
|**unary -**|- used for negation (unary minus) is next|In 2 * -x, the -x is computed first, with the result then multiplied by 2.|
|*** / %**|Next to be evaluated are *, /, and %, having equal precedence.|(% is discussed elsewhere)|
|**+ -**|Finally come + and - with equal precedence.|In y = 3 + 2 * x, the 2 * x is evaluated first, with the result then added to 3, because * has higher precedence than +. Spacing doesn't matter: y = 3+2 * x would still evaluate 2 * x first.|
|**left-to-right**|If more than one operator of equal precedence could be evaluated, evaluation occurs left to right.|In y = x * 2 / 3, the x * 2 is first evaluated, with the result then divided by 3.|

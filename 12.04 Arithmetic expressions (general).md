# 12.04 Arithmetic expressions (general)

## Basics
An **expression** is any individual item or combination of items.   
A common place where expressions are used is on the right side of an assignment statement.   
Ex) y = <ins>2 * (x + 1)</ins> -> **expression**   

A literal is a specific value in code like 2.   
Ex) y = <ins>2</ins> * (x + 1) -> **literal**    

An **operator** is a symbol that performs a built-in calculation, like +, which performs addition.

# 12.15 Strings

## Strings and string literals
A **string** is a sequence of characters.   
A string literal surrounds a character sequence with **double quotes**.   
Various characters may be in a string, such as letters, numbers, spaces, or symbols like $ or %.   
Earlier sections showed string literals being output, as in: ``printf("Hello");``.   

## String variables and assignments
Some variables should hold a string.   
A string data type isn't built into C like char, int, or double, but can be stored in a **character array**.   
A **character array** is a sequence of items.     
A programmer can declare a string as ``char firstName[50];``, which can store 50 characters.   
This material may refer to a character array as a string or a **C string**.   

A programmer can not assign a string with a value like for other types.   
Ex) str1 = "Hello" or str1 = str2 will cause a compiler error.   
Instead, programmer sets a string with a value using the function strcpy(str1, str2).

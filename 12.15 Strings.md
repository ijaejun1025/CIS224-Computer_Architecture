# 12.15 Strings

## Strings and string literals
A **string** is a sequence of characters.   
A string literal surrounds a character sequence with **double quotes**.   
Various characters may be in a string, such as letters, numbers, spaces, or symbols like $ or %.   
Earlier sections showed string literals being output, as in: ``printf("Hello");``.

# 12.15 Strings

## Strings and string literals
A **string** is a sequence of characters.   
A string literal surrounds a character sequence with **double quotes**.   
Various characters may be in a string, such as letters, numbers, spaces, or symbols like $ or %.   
Earlier sections showed string literals being output, as in: ``printf("Hello");``.   

## String variables and assignments
Some variables should hold a string.   
A string data type isn't built into C like char, int, or double, but can be stored in a **character array**.   
A **character array** is a sequence of items.     
A programmer can declare a string as ``char firstName[50];``, which can store 50 characters.   
This material may refer to a character array as a string or a **C string**.   

A programmer can not assign a string with a value like for other types.   
Ex) ``str1 = "Hello"`` or ``str1 = str2`` will cause a compiler error.   
Instead, programmer sets a string with a value using the function **strcpy(str1, str2)**.   
str1 must be at least as large as str2, else a runtime error may occur.   
A programmer must add ``#include <string.h>`` to use strcpy.

Initializing a string is an exception.   
``char firstMonth[8] = "January";`` is allowed.   
Strings are always terminated with a special character called the **null character, '\0'**.   
To hold the string "January", 8 characters are needed, 'J', 'a', 'n', 'u', 'a', 'r', 'y', '\0'.   
A programmer can omit the size as in ``char firstMonth[] = "January";``.   

```c
// Declaring and assigning a string.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
  char sentenceSubject[20];
  char sentenceVerb[20];
  char sentenceObject[20] = "an apple";

  strcpy(sentenceSubject, "boy");
  strcpy(sentenceVerb, "ate");

  printf("A ");
  printf("%s ", sentenceSubject);
  printf("%s ", sentenceVerb);
  printf("%s.\n", sentenceObject);

  return 0;
  // result: A boy ate an apple.
}
```

## Getting a string without whitespaces from input
A **whitespace character** is a character used to represent horizontal and vertical spaces in text.   
Ex) "Oh my goodness!" has two whitespace characters, one between h and m, the other between y and g.   
The approach automatically skips initial whitespace, then gets characters until the next whitespace is seen.   

``scanf("%s", userString);``   
When using scanf for a string, the subsequent string variable is not preceded by a **&** symbol.   
A char array variable is already an address, namely the address of the first character in the character sequence.

```c
scanf("%s", userString);

// 1) Hi there             -> Hi
// 2) Hello! I'm tired     -> Hello!
// 3)       Very fun.      -> Very
```

## Example: Word game
```c
// Strings example: Word game

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char wordRelative[50];
  char wordFood[50];
  char wordAdjective[50];
  char wordTimePeriod[50];

  // Get user's words
  printf("Type input (< 50 char) w/o spaces.\n");

  printf("Enter a kind of relative:\n");
  scanf("%s", wordRelative);

  printf("Enter a kind of food:\n");
  scanf("%s", wordFood);

  printf("Enter an adjective:\n");
  scanf("%s", wordAdjective);

  printf("Enter a time period:\n");
  scanf("%s", wordTimePeriod);

  // Tell the story
  printf("\n");
  printf("My %s", wordRelative);
  printf(" says eating %s \n", wordFood);
  printf("will make me more %s, \n", wordAdjective);
  printf("so now I eat it every %s.\n", wordTimePeriod);

  return 0;
  /*
    Type input (< 50 chars) w/o spaces.
    Enter a kind of relative:
    -> mother
    Enter a kind of food:
    -> apples
    Enter an adjective:
    -> loud
    Enter a time period:
    -> week

    My mother says eating apples 
    will make me more loud, 
    so now I eat it every week.
}
```

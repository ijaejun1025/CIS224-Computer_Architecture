# 11.10 Why whitespace matters

## Whitespace and precise formatting
**Whitespace** is any blank space or newline.   

## Programming is all about precision
Programs must be created precisely to run correctly.   
In programming, every little detail counts.   
* = and == have different meanings.
* Using i where j was meant can yield a hard-to-find bug.
* Declaring a variable as int when char was needed can cause confusing errors.
* Not considering that n could be 0 in sum/n can cause a program to fail entirely.
* The difference between typing x/2 vs. x/2.0 can have huge impacts.
* Counting from i being 0 to i < 10 vs. i <= 10 can mean the difference.

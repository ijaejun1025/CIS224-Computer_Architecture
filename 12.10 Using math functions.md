# 12.10 Using math functions

## Basics
Some programs require math operations beyond +, -, *, /, like computing a square root.   
A standard **math library** has about 20 math operations, known as functions.   
A programmer can include the library and then use those math functions.   

A function is a list of statements executed by invoking the function's name, such invoking is known as a **function call**.   
Any function input values, or **arguments**, appear within ( ), separated by commas if more than one.   
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(void) { 
  double sideSquare;
  double areaSquare = 49.0;
 
  sideSquare = sqrt(areaSquare);

  printf("Square root of %lf", areaSquare);
  printf(" is %lf\n", sideSquare);

  return 0;
}
```

## A few common math functions from the math library.
|Function|Behavior|Example|
|--------|--------|-------|
|sqrt(x)|Square root of x|sqrt(9.0) evaluates to 3.0.|
|pow(x, y)|Power: x^y|pow(6.0, 2.0) evaluates to 36.0.|
|fabs(x)|Absolute value of x|fabs(-99.5) evaluates to 99.5.|

## Example: Mass growth
The example below computes the growth of a biological mass, such as a tree.   
If the growth rate is 5% per year, the program computes 1.05 raised to the number of years.   
A similar program could calculate growth of money given an interest rate.   
```c
// Math function example: Mass growth.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(void) {
  double initMass;   // Initial mass of a substance
  double growthRate; // Annual growth rate
  double yearsGrow;  // Years of growth
  double finalMass;  // Final mass after those years
   
  printf("Enter initial mass: ");
  scanf("%lf", &initMass);
   
  printf("Enter growth rate (Ex: 0.05 is 5%%/year): ");
  scanf("%lf", &growthRate);
   
  printf("Enter years of growth: ");
  scanf("%lf", &yearsGrow);
   
  finalMass = initMass * pow(1.0 + growthRate, yearsGrow);
  // Ex: Rate of 0.05 yields initMass * 1.05^yearsGrow
   
  printf("Final mass after %lf years is: %lf\n", yearsGrow, finalMass);
   
  return 0;
}
```

## Calls in arguments
Commonly a function call's argument itself includes a function call.   
Below, x^y is computed via pow(x, y).   
The result is used in an expression that is an argument to another call, in this case to pow() again: **pow(2.0, pow(x, y) + 1).**   
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(void) {
  double x;
  double y;
  double z;

  x = 3.0;
  y = 2.0;
  z = pow(2.0, pow(x, y) + 1);

  return 0;
}
```
```c
// 

```

# 12.10 Using math functions

## Basics
Some programs require math operations beyond +, -, *, /, like computing a square root.   
A standard **math library** has about 20 math operations, known as functions.   
A programmer can include the library and then use those math functions.   

A function is a list of statements executed by invoking the function's name, such invoking is known as a **function call**.   
Any function input values, or **arguments**, appear within ( ), separated by commas if more than one.   
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(void) { 
  double sideSquare;
  double areaSquare = 49.0;
 
  sideSquare = sqrt(areaSquare);

  printf("Square root of %lf", areaSquare);
  printf(" is %lf\n", sideSquare);

  return 0;
}
```

## A few common math functions from the math library.
|Function|Behavior|Example|
|--------|--------|-------|
|sqrt(x)|Square root of x|sqrt(9.0) evaluates to 3.0.|
|pow(x, y)|Power: x^y|pow(6.0, 2.0) evaluates to 36.0.|
|fabs(x)|Absolute value of x|fabs(-99.5) evaluates to 99.5.|

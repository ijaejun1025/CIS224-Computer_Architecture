# 12.17 Numeric data types

int and double are the most common numeric data types.   
However, several other numeric types exist.   

## Integer numeric data types
The following table summarizes available integer numeric data types.   

|Declaration|Size|Supported number range|Standard-defined minimum size|
|-----------|----|----------------------|-----------------------------|
|char|8 bits|-128 to 127|8 bits|
|short|16 bits|-32,768 to 32,767|16 bits|
|int|32 bits|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|16 bits|
|long|32 bits|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|32 bits|
|long long|64 bits|	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|64 bits|

**int** is the most commonly used integer type.   
**long long** is used for integers expected to exceed about 2 billion.   
``printf()`` and ``scanf()`` use ``%lld`` to specify a long long item.   
**short** is rarely used. It is used to save memory when storing many of smaller numbers.   
Similarly, **char** is rarely used to directly store a number.   

## Floating-point numeric data types
The following table summarizes available floating-point numeric types.   

|Declaration|Size|Supported number range|
|-----------|----|----------------------|
|float|32 bits|-3.4x10^38 to 3.4x10^38|
|double|64 bits|-1.7x10^308 to 1.7x10^308|

**float** is typically only used in memory-saving situations.   
An **overflow** occurs when the value being assigned to a variable is greater than the maximum value the variable can store.

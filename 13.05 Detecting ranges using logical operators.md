## Logical AND, OR, and NOT (general)
A **logical operator** treats operands as being true or false, and evaluates to **true or false**.   
Logical operators include **AND, OR, and NOT**.   
Programming languages use various symbols for those operators, but below the words AND, OR, and NOT are used for introductory purposes.

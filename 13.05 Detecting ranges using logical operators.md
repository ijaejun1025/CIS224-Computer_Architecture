# 13.05 Detecting ranges using logical operators

## Logical AND, OR, and NOT (general)
A **logical operator** treats operands as being true or false, and evaluates to **true or false**.   
Logical operators include **AND, OR, and NOT**.   
Programming languages use various symbols for those operators, but below the words AND, OR, and NOT are used for introductory purposes.

## Logical operators
Special symbols are used to represent the AND, OR, and NOT logical operators.   
Logical operators are commonly used in expressions of if-else statements.

## Detect number range
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int userAge;

   scanf("%d", &userAge);

   if ((userAge >= 18) && (userAge <= 25)) {
       printf("Eligible\n");
   }
   else {
      printf("Ineligible\n");
   }

   return 0;
}
```

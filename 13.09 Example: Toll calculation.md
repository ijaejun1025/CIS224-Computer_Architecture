# 13.09 Example: Toll calculation

## Calculating toll based on time of day
The section presents an example program that calculates the toll amount for travel along a toll road or toll lane.   
The toll amount is based on the time of day, day of the week, and number of people in the vehicle.   

|Time (am/pm)|Time (24 hour)|Toll amount|
|------------|-------------|------------|
|Before 6:00 am|Before 6:00|1.55|
|6:00 am to 9:59 am|6:00 to 9:59|4.65|
|10:00 am to 5:59 pm|10:00 to 17:59|2.35|
|6:00 pm and after|18:00 and after|1.55|

## Calculating toll based on time of day - Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void) {
   int timeHour;      // Time of travel hour (24 hour format)
   int timeMinute;    // Time of travel minute
   char inputColon;   // Used to read time format
   double tollAmount;
   
   printf("Enter time of travel (HH:MM in 24 hour format): ");
   
   // Read an integer (hour), colon (char), and integer (minute)
   scanf("%d%c%d", &timeHour, &inputColon, &timeMinute);
   
   // Determine toll based on hour of travel
   if (timeHour < 6) {         // Before 6:00 am
      tollAmount = 1.55;
   }
   else if (timeHour < 10) {   // 6 am to 9:59 am
      tollAmount = 4.65;
   }
   else if (timeHour < 18) {   // 10 am to 5:59 pm
      tollAmount = 2.35;
   }
   else {                      // 6 pm and after
      tollAmount = 1.55;
   }
   
   // Output time and toll amount
   printf("Toll at %d:", timeHour);
   
   // Output minute with formatting (discussed elsewhere) to
   // print two digits for minutes.
   printf("%02d is %lf", timeMinute, tollAmount);
   
   return 0;
}
```

## Calculating toll based on time of day and day of week
A toll road often has a different toll schedule for weekends and holidays than for weekdays.   
The table below lists the toll schedule for weekends and holidays.

|12:00 pm to 3:59 pm|12:00 to 15:59|3.45|
|4:00 pm to 6:59 pm|16:00 and 18:59|3.60|
|7:00 pm to 9:59 pm|19:00 and 21:59|3.05|

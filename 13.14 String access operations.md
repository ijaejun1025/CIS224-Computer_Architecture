# 13.14 String access operations

## String character indices
A string is a sequence of characters in memory.   
Each string character has a position number called an **index**, starting with 0 (not 1).

## Accessing string characters
The notation ``someString[x]`` accesses the character at index x of a string.   

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   char userWord[6];

   printf("Enter a 5-letter word: ");
   scanf("%s", userWord);

   printf("Scrambled: ");
   printf("%c", userWord[3]);
   printf("%c", userWord[1]);
   printf("%c", userWord[4]);
   printf("%c", userWord[0]);
   printf("%c", userWord[2]);
   printf("\n");

   return 0;
}
```

## Null character
So that code can detect where a string ends, the compiler ends a string with a **null** character, written as **'\0'**.    
The string's char array must be large enough to include the null character.   
Ex) "Hi" requires a char array of size at least 3 for the 'H', 'i', and the null character.

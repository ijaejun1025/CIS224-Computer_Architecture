# 13.07 Detecting multiple features with branches

## Multiple distinct if statements
A programmer can use multiple if statements in sequence to detect multiple features with independent actions.   
Multiple sequential if statements looks similar to a multi-branch if-else statement but has a very different meaning.   
Each if-statement is independent, and thus more than one branch can execute, in contrast to the multi-branch if-else arrangement.   

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int userAge;
   
   printf("Enter age: ");
   scanf("%d", &userAge);
   
   // Note that more than one "if" statement can execute
   if (userAge < 16) {
      printf("Enjoy your early years.\n");
   }
   
   if (userAge > 15) {
      printf("You are old enough to drive.\n");
   }
   
   if (userAge > 17) {
      printf("You are old enough to vote.\n");
   }
   
   if (userAge > 24) {
      printf("Most car rental companies will rent to you.\n");
   }
   
   if (userAge > 34) {
      printf("You can run for president.\n");
   }
   
   return 0;
}
```

## Nested if-else statements
A branch's statements can include any valid statements, including another if-else statement, which are known as **nested if-else** statements.     
Nested if statements are commonly used to make decisions that are based on multiple features.   

```c
if (numItems > 3) {     
   if (totalCost > 100) {       // numItems > 3 and totalCost > 100
      saleDiscount = 20;
   }
   else if (totalCost > 50) {  // numItems > 3 and totalCost > 50
      saleDiscount = 10;
   }
}
else if (numItems > 0) {
   ...
}
```

# 14.02 While loops

## While loop: Basics
A **while loop** is a program construct that repeatedly executes a list of sub-statements (known as the **loop body**) while the loop's expression evaluates to **true**.   
Each execution of the loop body is called an **iteration**.   
Once entering the loop body, execution continues to the body's end, even if the expression would become false midway through.   

```c
while (expression) { // Loop expression
    // Loop body: Executes if expression evaluated to true 
    // After body, execution jumps back to the "while"
}
// Statements that execute after the expression evaluates to false
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int currPower;
  char userChar;
 
  currPower = 2;
  userChar = 'y';
 
  while (userChar == 'y') {
     printf("%d\n", currPower);
     currPower = currPower * 2;
     scanf("%c", &userChar);
  }
 
  printf("Done\n");
 
  return 0;
}

// input: y y n
// output: 2 4 8
```

## Basic while loop example
The following Celsius to Fahrenheit example shows the common pattern of getting user input at the end of each loop iteration to determine whether to continue looping.   

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   double celsiusValue;
   double fahrenheitValue;
   char userChar;

   celsiusValue = 0.0;
   userChar = 'y';
   
   while (userChar == 'y') {
      fahrenheitValue = (celsiusValue * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32.0;

      printf("%lf C is ", celsiusValue);
      printf("%lf F\n", fahrenheitValue); 

      printf("Type y to continue, any other to quit: ");
      scanf(" %c", &userChar);

      celsiusValue = celsiusValue + 5;
      printf("\n");
   }

   printf("Goodbye.\n");

   return 0;
}

/*
    0.000000 C is 32.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    5.000000 C is 41.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    10.000000 C is 50.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    15.000000 C is 59.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    20.000000 C is 68.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    25.000000 C is 77.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    30.000000 C is 86.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    35.000000 C is 95.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: y

    40.000000 C is 104.000000 F
    Type y to continue, any other to quit: q

    Goodbye.

```

Notice the space before the %c in the ``scanf(" %c", &userChar)`` statement above.   
The space causes scanf to first read and discard any whitespace characters, including spaces ``(' ')``, tabs ``('\t')``, and newline ``('\n')`` characters, in the user input before reading and storing the character indicated by the %c format specifier.   

Above, if users presses key 'a' followed by pressing enter, the system sends two characters to the program: 'a' and then a newline character '\n'.   
If the statement was instead ``scanf("%c", &userChar)`` without the space, the scanf would read the '\n' into userChar and quit the program.   

A common error is to forget to insert a blank space at the beginning of a scanf statement, causing whitespace and newlines to not be skipped, usually resulting in odd program behavior. => ``scanf("%c", &userChar)``   

## Loop expressions
Various kinds of expressions are found in while loop expressions.   
For example, sometimes a loop is executed as long as a value is greater than another value, or less than another value.   
Sometimes a loop is executed as long as a value is NOT equal to another value.   

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int userNum;
 
  scanf("%d", &userNum);
 
  while (userNum > 0) {
     printf("%d\n", userNum % 10);
     userNum = userNum / 10;
  }
 
  return 0;
}
```

## Example: Ancestors
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   const int YEARS_PER_GEN = 20; // Approx. years per generation
   int userYear;                 // User input
   int consYear;                 // Year being considered
   int numAnc;                   // Approx. ancestors in considered year
   
   consYear = 2020;
   numAnc = 2;

   printf("Enter a past year (neg. for B.C.): ");
   scanf("%d", &userYear);
   
   while (consYear >= userYear) {
      printf("Ancestors in %d: %d\n", consYear, numAnc);
      
      numAnc = 2 * numAnc;                 // Each ancestor had two parents
      consYear = consYear - YEARS_PER_GEN; // Go back 1 generation
   }
   
   return 0;
}
```

# 14.02 While loops

## While loop: Basics
A **while loop** is a program construct that repeatedly executes a list of sub-statements (known as the **loop body**) while the loop's expression evaluates to **true**.   
Each execution of the loop body is called an **iteration**.   
Once entering the loop body, execution continues to the body's end, even if the expression would become false midway through.   

```c
while (expression) { // Loop expression
    // Loop body: Executes if expression evaluated to true 
    // After body, execution jumps back to the "while"
}
// Statements that execute after the expression evaluates to false
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int currPower;
  char userChar;
 
  currPower = 2;
  userChar = 'y';
 
  while (userChar == 'y') {
     printf("%d\n", currPower);
     currPower = currPower * 2;
     scanf("%c", &userChar);
  }
 
  printf("Done\n");
 
  return 0;
}

// input: y y n
// output: 2 4 8
```

## Basic while loop example
The following Celsius to Fahrenheit example shows the common pattern of getting user input at the end of each loop iteration to determine whether to continue looping.

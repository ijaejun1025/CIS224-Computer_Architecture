# 13.03 Detecting ranges with branches (general)

## Detecting ranges using if-elseif-else
An **if-elseif-else** structure can detect number ranges with each branch performing a different action for each range.   
Each expression only needs to indicate the upper range part.

## Using multi-branch if-else to detect ranges
The sequential nature of multi-branch if-else statements is useful to detect ranges of numbers.   
In the following example, the second branch expression is only reached if the first expression is false.   
So the second branch is taken if userAge < 16 is false (so 16 or greater) AND userAge is < 25, meaning userAge is between 16 - 24 (inclusive).

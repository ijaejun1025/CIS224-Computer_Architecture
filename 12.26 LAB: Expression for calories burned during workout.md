Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively.   
Output the average calories burned for a person.   
Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point.   

Ex) If the input is:   
```c
49 155 148 60
```
the output is:   
```c
Calories: 736.21 calories
```

## Answer
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

   double age, weight, heart_rate, Exercise_time;
   double result;
   
   scanf("%lf %lf %lf %lf", &age, &weight, &heart_rate, &Exercise_time);
   
   result = (((age * 0.2757) + (weight * 0.03295) + (heart_rate * 1.0781) - 75.4991) * Exercise_time) / 8.368;
   
   printf("Calories: %0.2lf calories", result);

   return 0;
}

```

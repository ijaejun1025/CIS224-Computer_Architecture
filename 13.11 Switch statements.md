# 13.11 Switch statements

## Switch statement
A **switch** statement can more clearly represent **multi-branch behavior** involving a variable being compared to constant values.   
The program executes the **first case** whose constant expression matches the value of the switch expression, executes that case's statements, and then jumps to the end.   
If no case matches, then the **default case** statements are executed.   

```c
// A switch statement can more clearly represent multi-branch behavior involving a variable being compared to constant values.
// The program executes the first case whose constant expression matches the value of the switch expression, executes that case's statements, and then jumps to the end.

switch (a) {
  case 0:
     // Print "zero"
     break;

  case 1:
     // Print "one"
     break;

  case 2:
     // Print "two"
     break;

   // If no case matches, then the default case statements are executed.
   default:
     // Print "unknown"
     break;
}
```

## Switch statement general form
The switch statement's expression should be an **integer** or **char**.    
The expression should not be a string or a floating-point type.    
Each case must have a constant expression like 2 or 'q'; a case expression cannot be a variable.   

The order of cases doesn't matter assuming break statements exist at the end of each case.   
Good practice is to always have a **default case** for a switch statement.   

## Switch example: Estimates a dog's age in human years
```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* Estimates dog's age in equivalent human years.
   Source: www.dogyears.com 
*/

int main(void) {
   int dogAgeYears;

   printf("Enter your dog's age (in years):\n");
   scanf("%d", &dogAgeYears);

   switch (dogAgeYears) {
      case 0:
         printf("That's 0..14 human years.\n");
         break;

      case 1:
         printf("That's 15 human years.\n");
         break;

      case 2:
         printf("That's 24 human years.\n");
         break;

      case 3:
         printf("That's 28 human years.\n");
         break;

      case 4:
         printf("That's 32 human years.\n");
         break;

      case 5:
         printf("That's 37 human years.\n");
         break;
         
      case 6:
         printf("That's 42 human years.\n");
         break;
      
      case 7:
         printf("That's 47 human years.\n");
         break;

      case 8:
         printf("That's 52 human years.\n");
         break;

      case 9:
         printf("That's 57 human years.\n");
         break;
         
      case 10:
         printf("That's 62 human years.\n");
         break;

      default:
         printf("Human years unknown.\n");
         break;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

## Omitting the break statement
Omitting the **break** statement for a case will cause the statements within the next case to be executed.   
Such "falling through" to the next case can be useful when multiple cases, such as cases 0, 1, and 2, should execute the same statements.   

The following extends the previous program for dog ages less than 1 year old.   
If the dog's age is 0, the program asks for the dog's age in months.   
Within the  ``switch (dogAgeMonths)`` statement, "falling through" is used to execute the same display statement for several values of dogAgeMonths. For example, if dogAgeMonths is 0, 1 or 2, the same statement executes.

# 13.11 Switch statements

## Switch statement
A switch statement can more clearly represent multi-branch behavior involving a variable being compared to constant values.   
The program executes the first case whose constant expression matches the value of the switch expression, executes that case's statements, and then jumps to the end.   
If no case matches, then the default case statements are executed.

# 13.11 Switch statements

## Switch statement
A **switch** statement can more clearly represent **multi-branch behavior** involving a variable being compared to constant values.   
The program executes the **first case** whose constant expression matches the value of the switch expression, executes that case's statements, and then jumps to the end.   
If no case matches, then the **default case** statements are executed.   

```c
// A switch statement can more clearly represent multi-branch behavior involving a variable being compared to constant values.
// The program executes the first case whose constant expression matches the value of the switch expression, executes that case's statements, and then jumps to the end.

switch (a) {
  case 0:
     // Print "zero"
     break;

  case 1:
     // Print "one"
     break;

  case 2:
     // Print "two"
     break;

   // If no case matches, then the default case statements are executed.
   default:
     // Print "unknown"
     break;
}
```

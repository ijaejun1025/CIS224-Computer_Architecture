# 13.02 Detecting equal values with branches

## Detecting if two items are equal using an if statement
An **if** statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true.   
**Braces** surround the if branch's statements.   
Braces { }, sometimes redundantly called curly braces, represent a grouping, such as a grouping of statements.   
Note: { } are braces, [ ] are brackets.   

The example below uses **==**.   
The **equality operator (==)** evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal.   

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int hotelRate;
  int numYears;

  hotelRate = 150;

  printf("Enter number of years married: ");
  scanf("%d", &numYears);

  if (numYears == 50) {
     printf("Congratulations on 50 years ");
     printf("of marriage!\n");

     hotelRate = hotelRate / 2;
  }

  printf("Your hotel rate: ");
  printf("%d\n", hotelRate);

  return 0;
  // result
  // Enter numbers of years married: 50
  // Congratulations on 50 years of marriage!
  // Your hotel rate: 75
}
```

## Equality and inequality operators
The **inequality operator (!=)** evaluates to true if the left and right sides are not equal, or different.   
An expression involving the equality or inequality operators evaluates to a Boolean value.   
A **Boolean** is a type that has just two values: **true or false**.

# 13.02 Detecting equal values with branches

## Detecting if two items are equal using an if statement
An **if** statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true.   
**Braces** surround the if branch's statements.   
Braces { }, sometimes redundantly called curly braces, represent a grouping, such as a grouping of statements.   
Note: { } are braces, [ ] are brackets.   
 
The **equality operator (==)** evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal.   

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int hotelRate;
  int numYears;

  hotelRate = 150;

  printf("Enter number of years married: ");
  scanf("%d", &numYears);

  if (numYears == 50) {
     printf("Congratulations on 50 years ");
     printf("of marriage!\n");

     hotelRate = hotelRate / 2;
  }

  printf("Your hotel rate: ");
  printf("%d\n", hotelRate);

  return 0;
  // result
  // Enter numbers of years married: 50
  // Congratulations on 50 years of marriage!
  // Your hotel rate: 75
}
```

## Equality and inequality operators
The **inequality operator (!=)** evaluates to true if the left and right sides are not equal, or different.   
An expression involving the equality or inequality operators evaluates to a Boolean value.   
A **Boolean** is a type that has just two values: **true or false**.

## If-else statement
An **if-else** statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true, and executes another group of statements otherwise.    

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int userNum;
   int divRemainder;

   printf("Enter a number: ");
   scanf("%d", &userNum);

   divRemainder = userNum % 2;

   if (divRemainder == 0) {
       printf("%d is even.\n", userNum);
   }
   else {
       printf("%d is odd.\n", userNum);
   }

   return 0;
}
```

## Multi-branch if-else statements
An If-else statement can be extended to have three (or more) branches.   
Each branch's expression is checked in sequence.    
As soon as one branch's expression is found to be true, that branch's statements execute and no subsequent branch is considered.   
If no expression is true, the else branch executes.   

```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int numYears;
   
   printf("Enter number years married: ");
   scanf("%d", &numYears);
   
   if (numYears == 1) {
      printf("Your first year -- great!\n");
   }
   else if (numYears == 10) {
      printf("A whole decade -- impressive.\n");
   }
   else if (numYears == 25) {
      printf("Your silver anniversary -- enjoy.\n");
   }
   else if (numYears == 50) {
      printf("Your golden anniversary -- amazing.\n");
   }
   else {
      printf("Nothing special.\n");
   }
   
   return 0;
}
```

## Comparing characters, strings, and floating-point types
The relational and equality operators work for **integer, character, and floating-point** built-in types.   
**Characters** compares their ASCII numerical encoding.   
**Floating-point** types should not be compared using the equality operators.   
The operators should not be used with **strings** => the string comparison function **strcmp()**.

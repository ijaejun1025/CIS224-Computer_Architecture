# 12.08 Scientific notation for floating-point literals

Scientific notation is useful for representing floating-point numbers that are much greater than or much less than 0.   
A floating-point literal using scientific notation is written using an **e** preceding the power-of-10 exponent.   
Ex) 6.02 x 10^23 -> 6.02e23   
Ex) 0.001 -> 1.0e-3   
```c
// Calculating atoms of gold

int main(void) {
  double avogadrosNumber = 6.02e23; // Approximation of atoms per mole  
  double gramsPerMoleGold = 196.9665;
  double gramsGold;
  double atomsGold;
   
  printf("Enter grams of gold: ");
  scanf("%lf", &gramsGold);
   
  atomsGold = gramsGold / gramsPerMoleGold * avogadrosNumber;
   
  printf("%lf grams of gold contains ", gramsGold);
  printf("%lf atoms\n", atomsGold);
   
  return 0;
}
```
```c
// Acceleration of gravity.

/*
Compute the acceleration of gravity for a given distance from the earth's center, distCenter, assigning the result to
accelGravity. The expression for the acceleration of gravity is: (G * M) / (d^2), where G is the gravitational constant 6.673
x 10^-11, M is the mass of the earth 5.98 x 10^24 (in kg) and d is the distance in meters from the earth's center (stored in
variable distCenter). Note: Assume distance is at least the radius of the earth.

# 12.08 Scientific notation for floating-point literals

Scientific notation is useful for representing floating-point numbers that are much greater than or much less than 0.   
A floating-point literal using scientific notation is written using an e preceding the power-of-10 exponent.   
Ex) 6.02 x 10^23 -> 4.02e23   
Ex) 0.001 -> 1.0e-3

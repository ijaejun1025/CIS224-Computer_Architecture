# 11.4 Errors and warnings

## Syntax errors
**Syntax error** is to violate a programming language's rules on how symbols can be combined to create a program.   
```c
int main(void) {

  printf("Traffic today")
  printf(" is very light\n");

  return 0;
  /* Syntax error
  main.c:5:27: error: expected ';' after expression
     printf("Traffic today")
                            ^
                            ;
  1 error generated.
  */
}
```

## Unclear error messages
Compiler error messages are often unclear or even misleading.   
```c
int main(void) {

  printf "Traffic today ";
  printf("is very light.\n");

  return 0;
  /* Error
  main.c:5:9: error: expected ';' after expression
    printf "Traffic today ";
          ^
          ;

  The compiler indicates a missing semicolon ';'. But the real error is the missing parentheses.
  */
}
```

## Fixing the first error
Focus on fixing just the first error reported by the compiler and then recompiling.   
The remaining error messages may be real but are more commonly irrelevant due to the compiler's confusion.   
1. Focus on FIRST error message, ignoring the rest.   
2. Look at reported line of first error message. If error found, fix. Else, look at previous few lines.   
3. Compile, repeat.   

## Logic errors
Because a **syntax error** is detected by the compiler, a syntax error is known as a type of **compile-time error**.   
A **logic error**, also called a **bug**, is an error that occurs while a program runs.   
```c
int main(void) {
  int numBeans;
  int numJars;
  int totalBeans;

  numBeans = 500;
  numJars = 3;

  printf("%d beans in ", numBeans);
  printf("%d jars yields ", numJars);
  totalBeans = numBeans + numJars; // Used + instead of *
  printf("%d total\n", totalBeans);

  return 0;
}  
```

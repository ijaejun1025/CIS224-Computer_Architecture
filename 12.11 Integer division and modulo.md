# 12.11 Integer division and modulo

## Division: Integer rounding
When the operands of / are integers, the operator performs integer division, which does not generate any fraction.   
The / operator performs floating-point division if at least one operand is a floating-point type.   
```c
y = 10 / 4               // result = 2
y = 3 / 4                // result = 0
a = (1 / 2) * b * h      // result = 0
f = c * (9 / 5) + 32     // result = c + 32
y = 10 / 4               // result = 2
y = 10 / 4.0             // result = 2.5
```

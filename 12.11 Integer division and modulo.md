# 12.11 Integer division and modulo

## Division: Integer rounding
When the operands of / are integers, the operator performs integer division, which does not generate any fraction.   
The / operator performs floating-point division if at least one operand is a floating-point type.   
```c
y = 10 / 4               // result = 2
y = 3 / 4                // result = 0
a = (1 / 2) * b * h      // result = 0
f = c * (9 / 5) + 32     // result = c + 32
y = 10 / 4               // result = 2
y = 10 / 4.0             // result = 2.5
```

## Division: Divide by 0
For integer division, the second operand of / or % must never be 0, because division by 0 is mathematically undefined.   
A **divide-by-zero error** occurs at runtime if a divisor is 0, causing a program to terminate.   
A divide-by-zero error is an example of a **runtime error**, a severe error that occurs at runtime and causes a program to terminate early.
```c
// Divide-by-zero example: Compute salary per day.

int main(void) {
  int salaryPerYear; // User input: Yearly salary
  int daysPerYear;   // User input: Days worked per year
  int salaryPerDay;  // Output:     Salary per day

  printf("Enter yearly salary: ");
  scanf("%d", &salaryPerYear);

  printf("Enter days worked per year: ");
  scanf("%d", &daysPerYear);

  // If daysPerYear is 0, then divide-by-zero causes program termination.
  salaryPerDay = salaryPerYear / daysPerYear;

  printf("Salary per day is: %d\n", salaryPerDay);

  return 0;
}
```

## Modulo (%)
The basic arithmetic operators include not just +, -, *, /, but also %.   
The **modulo operator (%)** evaluates the remainder of the division of two integer operands.   
Ex) 24 % 10 is 4. Reason: 24 / 10 is 2 with remainder 4.   
Ex) 50 % 50 is 0. Reason: 50 / 50 is 1 with remainder 0.   
Ex) 1 % 2 is 1. Reason: 1 / 2 is 0 with remainder 1.   
Ex) 10 % 4.0 is not valid. **"Remainder" only makes sense for integer operands.**   
```c
// Division and modulo example: Minutes to hours/minutes.

int main(void) {
  int userMinutes;  // User input: Minutes
  int outHours;     // Output hours
  int outMinutes;   // Output minutes (remaining)

  printf("Enter minutes: ");
  scanf("%d", &userMinutes);

  outHours   = userMinutes / 60;
  outMinutes = userMinutes % 60;

  printf("%d minutes is ", userMinutes);
  printf("%d hours and ", outHours);
  printf("%d minutes.\n", outMinutes);

  return 0;
}
```

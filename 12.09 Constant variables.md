# 12.09 Constant variables

If the programmer precedes the variable declaration with the keyword **const**,   
-> The compiler will report an **error** if a later statement tries to change that variable's value.   
An initialized variable whose value cannot change is called a **constant variable**.   
A common convention is to name constant variables using upper case letters with words separated by underscores.   
```c
// Constant variable example: Lightning distance.
// Estimates distance of lightning based on seconds between lightning and thunder.

int main(void) {
  const double SPEED_OF_SOUND   = 761.207; // Miles/hour (sea level)
  const double SECONDS_PER_HOUR = 3600.0;  // Secs/hour
  // If programmer try to change SPEED_OF_SOUND or SECONDS_PER_HOUR later, the program will make error.
  double secondsBetween;
  double timeInHours;
  double distInMiles;

  printf("Enter seconds between lightning and thunder: ");
  scanf("%lf", &secondsBetween);

  timeInHours = secondsBetween / SECONDS_PER_HOUR;
  distInMiles = SPEED_OF_SOUND * timeInHours;

  printf("Lightning strike was approximately\n");
  printf("%lf", distInMiles);
  printf(" miles away.\n");

  return 0;
}
```
```c
// Using constants in expressions.

int main(void) {
  int shipWeightPounds;
  int shipCostCents = 0;
  const int FLAT_FEE_CENTS = 75;
  const int CENTS_PER_POUND = 25;
   
  scanf("%d", &shipWeightPounds);
   
  shipCostCents = FLAT_FEE_CENTS + (CENTS_PER_POUND * shipWeightPounds);

  printf("Weight(lb): %d, Flat fee(cents): %d, Cents per pound: %d\nShipping cost(cents): %d\n",
          shipWeightPounds, FLAT_FEE_CENTS, CENTS_PER_POUND, shipCostCents);

  return 0;
}
```

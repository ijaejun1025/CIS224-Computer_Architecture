# 12.27 LAB: Using math functions

Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output x to the power of z, x to the power of (y to the power of 2), the absolute value of y, and the square root of (xy to the power of z).   
* x to the power of z
* x to the power of (y to the power of 2)
* the absolute value of y
* the square root of (xy to the power of z)

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point.   

Ex) If the input is:
```c
5.0 6.5 3.2
```
the output is:
```c
172.47 340002948455826440449068892160.00 6.50 262.43
```

## Answer
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   double x;
   double y;
   double z;

   scanf("%lf %lf %lf", &x, &y, &z);
   
   printf("%0.2lf %0.2lf %0.2lf %0.2lf\n", pow(x, z), pow(x, pow(y, 2)), fabs(y), sqrt(pow(x*y, z)));

   return 0;
}
```

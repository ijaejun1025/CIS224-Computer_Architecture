# 12.27 LAB: Using math functions

Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output x to the power of z, x to the power of (y to the power of 2), the absolute value of y, and the square root of (xy to the power of z).   
1. x to the power of z
2. x to the power of (y to the power of 2)
3. the absolute value of y
4. the square root of (xy to the power of z)

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point.   

Ex) If the input is:
```c
5.0 6.5 3.2
```
the output is:
```c
172.47 340002948455826440449068892160.00 6.50 262.43
```

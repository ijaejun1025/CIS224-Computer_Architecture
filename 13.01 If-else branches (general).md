# 13.01 If-else branches (general)

## Branch basics (If)
In a program, a **branch** is a sequence of statements only executed under a certain condition.   
An **if** branch is a branch taken only IF an expression is true.

## If-else branches
An **if-else** branch has two branches.   
The first branch is executed IF an expression is true, ELSE the other branch is executed.

## If-elseif-else branches
Commonly a programmer wishes to take one of multiple (three or more) branches.    
An if-else can be extended to an **if-elseif-else** structure.   
Each branch's expression is checked in sequence; as soon as one branch's expression is found to be true, that branch is taken.   
If no expression is found true, execution will reach the else branch, which then executes.

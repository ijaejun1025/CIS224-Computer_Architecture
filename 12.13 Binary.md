# 12.13 Binary

Because each memory location is composed of bits (0s and 1s), a processor stores a number using base 2, known as a **binary number**.   
For a number in the more familiar base 10, known as a **decimal number**, each digit must be 0-9 and each digit's place is weighed by increasing powers of 10.

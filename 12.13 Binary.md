# 12.13 Binary

## Decimal number
For a number in the more familiar **base 10**, each digit must be 0-9 and each digit's place is weighed by increasing powers of 10.

## Binary number
Because each memory location is composed of bits (0s and 1s), a processor stores a number using **base 2**.   
In **base 2**, each digit must be 0-1 and each digit's place is weighed by increasing powers of 2.

The compiler translates decimal numbers into binary numbers before storing the number into a memory location.   
The compiler would convert the decimal number 212 to the binary number 11010100.   
(1 x 128) + (1 x 64) + (0 x 32) +(1 x 16) + (0 x 8) + (1 x 4) + (0 x 2) + (0 x 1) = 212, and then store that binary number in memory.

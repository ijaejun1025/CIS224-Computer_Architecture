# 14.01 Loops (general)

## Loop basics
A **loop** is a program construct that repeatedly executes the loop's statements (known as the **loop body**) while the loop's expression is **true**.   
When the expression is **false**, execution proceeds past the loop.   
Each time through a loop's statements is called an **iteration**.

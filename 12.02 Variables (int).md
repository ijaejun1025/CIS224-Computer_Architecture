# 12.2 Variables (int)

## Variable declarations
A **variable declaration** is a statement that declares a new variable, specifying the **variable's name and type**.   
Ex) int userAge; -> Declares a new variable named userAge that can hold an integer value.   
**Allocation** is the process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like variables.   
Ex) The compiler has given userAge memory location 97, which is known as the variable's address.   
```c
int main(void) {
  // Compiler allocates a memory location for userAge, in this case location 97.
  int userAge;

  printf("Enter your age: ");

  // The processor writes the value into the variable's memory location.
  scanf("%d", &userAge);

  // Reading a variable's value reads the value from the variable's memory location.
  printf("%d", userAge);

  printf(" is a great age.\n");

  return 0
}
```

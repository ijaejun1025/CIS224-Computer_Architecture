# 12.2 Variables (int)

## Variable declarations
A **variable declaration** is a statement that declares a new variable, specifying the **variable's name and type**.   
Ex) int userAge; -> Declares a new variable named userAge that can hold an integer value.   
**Allocation** is the process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like variables.   
Ex) The compiler has given userAge memory location 97, which is known as the variable's address.   
```c
int main(void) {
  // Compiler allocates a memory location for userAge, in this case location 97.
  int userAge;

  printf("Enter your age: ");

  // The processor writes the value into the variable's memory location.
  scanf("%d", &userAge);

  // Reading a variable's value reads the value from the variable's memory location.
  printf("%d", userAge);

  printf(" is a great age.\n");

  return 0
}
```

## Assignment statements
An **assignment statement** assigns the variable on the left-side with the current value of the right-side expression.   
Ex)numApples = 8; -> assigns numApples with the value of the right-side expression 8.   
An **expression** may be a **number** like 80, a **variable name** like numApples, or a **calculation** like numApples + 1.   
Simple calculations can involve standard **math operators** like +, -, and *, and **parentheses** as in 2 * (numApples - 1).   
An integer like 80 appearing in an expression is known as an **integer literal**.   
```c
int main(void) {
  int litterSize;
  int yearlyLitters;
  int annualMice;

  littleSize = 3; // Low end of litter size range
  yearlyLitters = 5; // Low end of litters per year

  printf("One female mouse may give birth to ");
  auualMice = litterSize * yearlyLitters;
  print("%d mice,\n", annualMice);

  litterSize = 14; // High end
  yearlyLitters = 10 // High end

  printf("and up to ")
  annualMice = litterSize * yearlyLitters;
  printf("%d mice, in a year.\n", annualMice);
}
```

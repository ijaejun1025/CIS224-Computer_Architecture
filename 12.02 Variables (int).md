# 12.02 Variables (int)

## Variable declarations
A **variable declaration** is a statement that declares a new variable, specifying the **variable's name and type**.   
Ex) int userAge; -> Declares a new variable named userAge that can hold an integer value.   
**Allocation** is the process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like variables.   
Ex) The compiler has given userAge memory location 97, which is known as the variable's address.   
```c
int main(void) {
  // Compiler allocates a memory location for userAge, in this case location 97.
  int userAge;

  printf("Enter your age: ");

  // The processor writes the value into the variable's memory location.
  scanf("%d", &userAge);

  // Reading a variable's value reads the value from the variable's memory location.
  printf("%d", userAge);

  printf(" is a great age.\n");

  return 0
}
```

## Assignment statements
An **assignment statement** assigns the variable on the left-side with the current value of the right-side expression.   
Ex)numApples = 8; -> assigns numApples with the value of the right-side expression 8.   
An **expression** may be a **number** like 80, a **variable name** like numApples, or a **calculation** like numApples + 1.   
Simple calculations can involve standard **math operators** like +, -, and *, and **parentheses** as in 2 * (numApples - 1).   
An integer like 80 appearing in an expression is known as an **integer literal**.   
```c
int main(void) {
  int litterSize;
  int yearlyLitters;
  int annualMice;

  littleSize = 3; // Low end of litter size range
  yearlyLitters = 5; // Low end of litters per year

  printf("One female mouse may give birth to ");
  auualMice = litterSize * yearlyLitters;
  print("%d mice,\n", annualMice);

  litterSize = 14; // High end
  yearlyLitters = 10 // High end

  printf("and up to ")
  annualMice = litterSize * yearlyLitters;
  printf("%d mice, in a year.\n", annualMice);
}
```
```c
int main(void) {
  int numCoins;
  int numNickels;
  int numDimes;

  numNickels = 5;
  numDimes = 6;

  printf("There are %d coins\n", numCoins);

  return 0;
}
```

## Initializing variables
Although not required, an integer variable is often assigned an initial value when declared.   
Ex) int maxScore = 100; -> Declares an int variable named maxScore with an initial value of 100.
```c
int main(void) {
  // Declares an int variable named avgLifespan with an initial value of 70.
  int avgLifespan = 70;
  int userAge;

  printf("Enter your age: ");
  scanf("%d", &userAge);
  printf("%d is a great age\n", userAge);

  printf("Average lifespan is %d\n", avgLifespan);

  return 0;
}
```

## Assignment statement with same variable on both sides
A variable appears on both the right and left side of the = operator.   
Ex) If numItems is 5, after numItems = numItems + 1; executes, numItems will be 6.   
```c
int main(void) {
  // The compiler allocated memory for variables.
  int yourFriends;
  int totalFriends;

  printf("Enter the number of people you know: ");

  // The scanf statement assigns yourFriends with user input.
  scanf("%d",  &yourFriends);

  // totalFriends is assigned with the value of yourFriends.
  totalFriends = yourFriends;

  // The printf statement outputs totalFriends.
  printf(" You know %d people.\n", totalFriends);

  // The assignment statement reads totalFriends (200) and yourFriends (200)
  // Multiplies those values, and assigns totalFriends with the product of 40000.
  totalFriends = totalFriends * yourFriends;

  // The printf statement outputs totalFriends.
  printf(" Those people know %d people.\n", totalFriends);

  // Assignment reads totalFriends (now 40000) and yourFriends (200)
  // Multiplies those values, and assigns totalFriends with the result of 8000000.
  totalFriends = totalFriends * yourFriends;

  printf(" And they know %d people.\n\n", totalFriends);
          
  return 0;
}
```

## Common errors
A common error is to read a variable that has not yet been assigned a value.     
A programmer must ensure that a program assigns a variable with a value before reading.

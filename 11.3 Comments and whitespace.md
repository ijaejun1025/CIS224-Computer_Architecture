# 11.3 Comments and whitespace

## Comments
A comment is text a programmer adds to code.   
A **single-line comment** starts with // and includes all the following text on that line.   
A **multi-line comment** starts with /* and ends with \*/, all text between /* and \*/ is part of the comment.   
```c
/*
  This program calculates the amount of pasta to cook, given the
  number of people eating.
 
  Author: Andrea Giada
  Date:   May 30, 2017
*/

int main(void) {
  int numPeople;         // Number of people that will be eating
  int totalOuncesPasta;  // Total ounces of pasta to serve numPeople
 
  // Get number of people
  printf("Enter number of people: \n");
  scanf("%d", &numPeople);
 
  // Calculate and print total ounces of pasta
  totalOuncesPasta = numPeople * 3;  // Typical ounces per person
  printf("Cook %d ounces of pasta.\n", totalOuncesPasta);

  return 0;
}
```

## Whitespace
Whitespace refers to blank spaces between items within a statement and blank lines between statements.   
1. Use blank lines to separate conceptually distinct statements.
2. Indent lines the same amount.
3. Align items to reduce visual clutter.
4. Use a single space before and after any operators like =, +, *, or / to make statements more readable.
```c
int main(void) {
  int myFirstVar;    // Aligned comments yield less
  int yetAnotherVar; // visual clutter 
  int thirdVar;
   
  // Above blank line separates variable declarations from the rest
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &myFirstVar); 
   
  // Above blank line separates user input statements from the rest
  yetAnotherVar = myFirstVar;        // Aligned = operators
  thirdVar      = yetAnotherVar + 1; 
  // Also notice the single-space on left and right of + and =
  // (except when aligning the second = with the first =)
   
  printf("Final value is %d\n", thirdVar); // Single-space after the ,
   
  return 0; // The above blank line separates the return from the rest
}
```

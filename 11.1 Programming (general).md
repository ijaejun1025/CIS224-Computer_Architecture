## Computer program basics
A computer **program** consists of instructions executing one at a time.   

**Input:** A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.   
**Process:** A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.   
**Output:** A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.   

Programs use **variables** to refer to data.   
The name is due to a variable's value varying as a program assigns a variable like x with new values.   

## omputational thinking
**Mathematical thinking** became increasingly important throughout the industrial age.
In the information age, many people believe **computational thinking**, or creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem, will become increasingly important for work and everyday life.
A sequence of instructions that solves a problem is called an **algorithm**.

# 11.1 Programming (general)

## Computer program basics
A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time.   

**Input:** A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.   
**Process:** A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.   
**Output:** A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.

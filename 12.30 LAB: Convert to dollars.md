# 12.30 LAB: Convert to dollars

Given three input values representing counts of nickels, dimes, and quarters, output the total amount as dollars and cents.   
Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point.   

Ex) If the input is:   
```c
3 1 4
```
3 is the number of nickels (at $0.05 each)   
1 is the number of dimes (at $0.10 each)   
4 is the number of quarters (at $0.25 each)   
the output is:   
```c
Amount: $1.25
```

## Answer
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

   int nickels, dimes, quarters;
   double result;
   
   scanf("%d %d %d", &nickels, &dimes, &quarters);
   
   result = ((double)(nickels) * 0.05) + ((double)(dimes) * 0.10) + ((double)(quarters) * 0.25);
   
   printf("Amount: $%0.2lf\n", result);

   return 0;
}
```

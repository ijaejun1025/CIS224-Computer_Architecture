# 12.06 Example: Health data

## Calculating user's age in days
The section presents a program that computes various health related data based on a user's age using incremental development.   
**Incremental development** is the process of writing, compiling, and testing a small amount of code.   
The initial program below calculates a user's age in days based on the user's age in years.   
```c
int main(void) {
  int userAgeYears;
  int userAgeDays;
   
  printf("Enter your age in years: ");
  scanf("%d", &userAgeYears);
   
  userAgeDays = userAgeYears * 365;
   
  printf("You are %d days old.\n", userAgeDays);
   
  return 0;
}
```

# 12.06 Example: Health data

## Calculating user's age in days
The section presents a program that computes various health related data based on a user's age.   
This program will use **incremental development**.   
**Incremental development** is the process of writing, compiling, and testing a small amount of code.   
The initial program below calculates a user's age in days based on the user's age in years.   
```c
// Health data: Calculating user's age in days.

int main(void) {
  int userAgeYears;
  int userAgeDays;
   
  printf("Enter your age in years: ");
  scanf("%d", &userAgeYears);
   
  userAgeDays = userAgeYears * 365;
   
  printf("You are %d days old.\n", userAgeDays);
   
  return 0;
}
```

## Considering leap years and calculating age in minutes
The program below extends the previous program by accounting for leap years when calculating the user's age in days.   
Each leap year has one extra day.   
The statement userAgeDays = userAgeDays + (userAgeYears / 4) adds the number of leap years to userAgeDays.

# 12.06 Example: Health data

## Calculating user's age in days
The section presents a program that computes various health related data based on a user's age.   
This program will use **incremental development**.   
**Incremental development** is the process of writing, compiling, and testing a small amount of code.   
The initial program below calculates a user's age in days based on the user's age in years.   
```c
// Health data: Calculating user's age in days.

int main(void) {
  int userAgeYears;
  int userAgeDays;
   
  printf("Enter your age in years: ");
  scanf("%d", &userAgeYears);
   
  userAgeDays = userAgeYears * 365;
   
  printf("You are %d days old.\n", userAgeDays);
   
  return 0;
}
```

## Considering leap years and calculating age in minutes
The program below extends the previous program by accounting for leap years when calculating the user's age in days.   
Since each leap year has one extra day, the statement adds the number of leap years to userAgeDays.   
The program also computes and outputs the user's age in minutes.   
```c
// Health data: Calculating user's age in days and minutes.

int main(void) {
  int userAgeYears;
  int userAgeDays;
  int userAgeMinutes;
   
  printf("Enter your age in years: ");
  scanf("%d", &userAgeYears);
   
  userAgeDays = userAgeYears * 365;               // Calculate days without leap years
  userAgeDays = userAgeDays + (userAgeYears / 4); // Add days for leap years
   
  printf("You are %d days old.\n", userAgeDays);
   
  userAgeMinutes = userAgeDays * 24 * 60;         // 24 hours/day, 60 minutes/hour
  printf("You are %d minutes old.\n", userAgeMinutes);
   
  return 0;
}
```

## Estimating total heartbeats in user's lifetime
The program is incrementally extended again to calculate the approximate number of times the user's heart has beat in the user's lifetime using an average heart rate of 72 beats per minutes.   
```c
// Health data: Calculating total heartbeats lifetime.

int main(void) {
  int userAgeYears;
  int userAgeDays;
  int userAgeMinutes;
  int totalHeartbeats;
  int avgBeatsPerMinute = 72;
   
  printf("Enter your age in years: ");
  scanf("%d", &userAgeYears);
   
  userAgeDays = userAgeYears * 365;               // Calculate days without leap years
  userAgeDays = userAgeDays + (userAgeYears / 4); // Add days for leap years
   
  printf("You are %d days old.\n", userAgeDays);
   
  userAgeMinutes = userAgeDays * 24 * 60;         // 24 hours/day, 60 minutes/hour
  printf("You are %d minutes old.\n", userAgeMinutes);   

  totalHeartbeats = userAgeMinutes * avgBeatsPerMinute;
  printf("Your heart has beat %d times.\n", totalHeartbeats);

  return 0;
}
```

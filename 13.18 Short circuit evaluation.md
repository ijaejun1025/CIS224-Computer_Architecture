# 13.18 Short circuit evaluation

A logical operator evaluates operands from left to right.   
**Short circuit** evaluation skips evaluating later operands if the result of the logical operator can already be determined.    
The logical **AND** operator short circuits to false if the first operand evaluates to false, and skips evaluating the second operand.   
The logical **OR** operator short circuits to true if the first operand is true, and skips evaluating the second operand.

# 12.3 Identifiers

## Rules for identifiers
A name created by a programmer for an item like a variable or function is called an **identifier**.   
* An identifier must be a sequence of letters (a-z, A-Z), underscores (_), and digits (0-9)
* An identifier must start with a letter or underscore.

Identifiers are **case sensitive**, meaning upper and lower case letters differ.   
A **reserved word** is a word that is part of the language, like **int, short, or double**.   
A reserved word is also known as a **keyword**.   
A programmer cannot use a reserved word as an identifier.

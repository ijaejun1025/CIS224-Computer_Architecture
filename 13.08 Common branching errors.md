# 13.08 Common branching errors

## Common error: Missing braces
When a branch has a single statement, the braces are optional, but good practice always uses the braces.   
Always using braces even when a branch only has one statement prevents the common error of mistakenly thinking a statement is part of a branch.   

```c
if (numSales < 20)
   salesBonus = 0;
else
   totBonus = totBonus + 1; 
   salesBonus = 20; // salesBonus = 20; is not part of else, so always executes.

if (numSales < 20) {
   salesBonus = 0;
}
else {
   totBonus = totBonus + 1; 
   salesBonus = 20;
}
```

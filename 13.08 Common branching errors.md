# 13.08 Common branching errors

## Common error: Missing braces
When a branch has a single statement, the braces are optional, but good practice always uses the braces.   
Always using braces even when a branch only has one statement prevents the common error of mistakenly thinking a statement is part of a branch.   

```c
if (numSales < 20)
   salesBonus = 0;
else
   totBonus = totBonus + 1; 
   salesBonus = 20; // salesBonus = 20; is not part of else, so always executes.


if (numSales < 20) {
   salesBonus = 0;
}
else {
   totBonus = totBonus + 1; 
   salesBonus = 20;
}
```

## Common error: Using the incorrect operators
Perhaps the most common error in C and C++ is to use = rather than == in an if-else expression.    
Ex) if (numDogs = 9) { ... }. That code is not a syntax error.    
The statement assigns numDogs with 9, and then because that value is non-zero, the expression is considered true.    
C's designers allowed assignment in expressions to allow compact code, and use = for assignment rather than := or similar to save typing.    
Many people believe those language design decisions were mistakes, leading to many bugs.   
Some modern compilers provide a warning when = appears in an if-else expression.   

Another common error is to use invalid character sequences like =>, !<, or <>, which are not valid operators.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int userNum;

   scanf("%d", &userNum); // Program will be tested with values: 1, 2, 3, 4.

   if (userNum != 2) {
      printf("Num is not two\n");
   }
   else {
      printf("Num is equal to two\n");
   }

   return 0;
}
```

The term computer has changed meaning over the years.   
The term originally referred to a person that performed computations by hand.   
* 1940s/1950s -> Large machines like in the earlier photo   
* 1970s/1980s -> Small home computers like personal computers or PCs and portable/laptop computers     
* 2000s/2010s -> Other computing devices like pads, book readers, and smart phones   
* Nowdays -> The term computer even refers to computing devices embedded inside other electronic devices.   

In the early days of computing, the physical equipment was prone to failures.   
As programs became larger, the term **software** became popular to distinguish a computer's programs from the **hardware**.   

A computer typically consists of several components     

* **Input/output devices**   
  * A **screen** displays itmes to a user. Today's computers display textual items and graphical items. **(Input)**   
  * A **keyboard** allows a user to provide input to the computer. **(Output)**   
  * A **Mouse** displays graphical items to a user. **(Input)**   
  * Keyboards and mice are increasingly being replaced by **touchscreens. (Input/Output)**   
  * Other devices provide input and output means, such as **microphones, speakers, printers, and USB interfaces.**   

* **Storage**
  * A **disk** stores files and other data.   
  * Disks are non-volatile, meaning they maintain their contents even when powered off.   
  * The disk spins under a head that pulses electricity at just the right times to orient specific particles.   
  * **Flash storage devices** store 0s and 1s in a non-volatile memory.

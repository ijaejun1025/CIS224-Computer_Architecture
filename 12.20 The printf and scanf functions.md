# 12.20 The printf and scanf functions

The ``printf()`` function is used to print output from a program.   
To use the ``printf()`` function, a program must include the stdio library using the statement ``#include <stdio.h>``.

The first argument to the printf() function is a format string.   
The **format string** defines the format of the text that will be printed along with any number of placeholders, known as format specifiers.   
A **format specifier** is a placeholder that defines the type of value that will be printed in its place.   
A format specifier begins with the **%** character followed by a sequence of characters that indicate the type of value to be printed.   

## Format specifiers for printf() and scanf() statements
|Format specifier|Data type|Notes|
|----------------|---------|-----|
|%c|char|Prints or reads a single ASCII character.|
|%d|int|Prints or reads a decimal integer value.|
|%hd|short|Prints or reads a short signed integer.|
|%ld|long|Prints or reads a long signed integer.|
|%lld|long long|Prints or reads a long long signed integer.|
|%u|unsigned int|Prints or reads an unsigned integer.|
|%hu|unsigned short|Prints or reads an unsigned short integer.|
|%lu|unsigned long|Prints or reads an unsigned long integer.|
|%llu|unsigned long long|Prints or reads an unsigned long long integer.|
|%f|float|Prints or reads a float floating-point value.|
|%lf|double|Prints or reads a double floating-point value (lf stands for long float).|
|%s|string|printf() will print the contents of a string (string literal or character array) up to the null character. scanf() will read a string of characters from the user input until a whitespace character (a space, tab, or newline) is reached.|

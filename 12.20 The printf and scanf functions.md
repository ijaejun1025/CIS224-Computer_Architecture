# 12.20 The printf and scanf functions

The ``printf()`` function is used to print output from a program.   
To use the ``printf()`` function, a program must include the stdio library using the statement ``#include <stdio.h>``.

The first argument to the printf() function is a format string.   
The **format string** defines the format of the text that will be printed along with any number of placeholders, known as format specifiers.

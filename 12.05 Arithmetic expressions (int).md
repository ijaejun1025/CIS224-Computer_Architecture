# 12.05 Arithmetic expressions (int)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/*
  Computes the total cost of leasing a car given the down payment,
  monthly rate, and number of months
*/

int main(void) {
  int downPayment;
  int paymentPerMonth;
  int numMonths;
  int totalCost;  // Computed total cost to be output

  printf("Enter down payment: ");
  scanf("%d", &downPayment);

  printf("Enter monthly payment: ");
  scanf("%d", &paymentPerMonth);

  printf("Enter number of months: ");
  scanf("%d", &numMonths);

  totalCost = downPayment + (paymentPerMonth * numMonths);

  printf("Total cost: %d\n", totalCost);

  return 0;
}
```

## Style: Single space around operators
A good practice is to include a **single space** around operators for readability   
Ex) numItems+2 -> numItems + 2   
An exception is minus used as negative, as xCoord = -yCoord   
Minus (-) used as negative is known as **unary minus**.   
```c
  housesCity = housesBlock *10; -> housesCity = housesBlock * 10;

  tot = num1+num2+2; -> tot = num1 + num2 + 2;

  numBalls=numBalls+1; -> numBalls = numBalls + 1;

  numEntries = (userVal+1)*2; -> numEntries = (userVal + 1) * 2;
```

## Compound operators
Special operators called **compound operators** provide a shorthand way to update a variable.   
Ex) userAge = userAge + 1 -> userAge += 1   
Other compound operators include **-=, *=, /=, and %=**.   
```c
  numAtoms = numAtoms + 5; -> numAtoms+=5;
  numAtoms = numAtoms * 2; -> numAtoms*=2;
  carCount = carCount / 2; -> carCount/=2; 
```

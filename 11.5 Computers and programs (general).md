## Switches
**1800s**   
People began using electricity for lights and machines, they created switches to turn objects on and off.   
A switch controls whether or not electricity flows through a wire.   

**1900s**   
People created special switches that could be controlled electronically, rather than by a person moving the switch up or down.   
In an electronically controlled switch, a positive voltage at the control input allows electricity to flow, while a zero voltage prevents the flow.   
The engineers treated a positive voltage as a "1" and a zero voltage as a "0".   
0s and 1s are known as **bits (binary digits)**.   
They built connections of switches, known as **circuits**, to perform calculations such as multiplying two numbers.     
These circuits became increasingly complex, leading to the first electronic computers in the 1930s and 1940s.   

## Processors and memory
Circuits called **processors** were created to process a list of desired calculations, with each calculation called an **instruction**.   
Instructions are stored in a memory.   
A **memory** is a circuit that can store 0s and 1s in each of a series of thousands of addressed locations.   
Instructions operate on data, which is also stored in memory locations as 0s and 1s.   
Thus, a computer is basically a processor interacting with a memory.   

## Instructions
Below are some sample types of instructions.   
|Instruction|Explanation|
|------|---|
|Add X, #num, Y|Adds data in memory location X to the number num, storing result in location Y.|
|Sub X, #num, Y|Subtracts num from data in location X, storing result in location Y.|
|Mul X, #num, Y|Multiplies data in location X by num, storing result in location Y.|
|Div X, #num, Y|Divides data in location X by num, storing result in location Y.|
|Jmp Z|Tells the processor that the next instruction to execute is in memory location Z.|

For example)   
"Mul 97, #9, 98" -> multiply the data in memory location 97 by the number 9, storing the result into memory location 98.   
If the data in location were 20, the instruction would multiply 20 by 9, storing the result 180 into location 98.   
That instruction would actually be stored in memory as 0s and 1s, such as "011 1100001 001001 1100010".

## Switches
**1800s**
People began using electricity for lights and machines, they created switches to turn objects on and off.   
A switch controls whether or not electricity flows through a wire.   

**1900s**
People created special switches that could be controlled electronically, rather than by a person moving the switch up or down.   
In an electronically controlled switch, a positive voltage at the control input allows electricity to flow, while a zero voltage prevents the flow.   
The engineers treated a positive voltage as a "1" and a zero voltage as a "0".   
0s and 1s are known as **bits (binary digits)**.

# 12.07 Floating-point numbers (double)

## Floating-point (double) variables
A **floating-point number** is a real number containing a decimal point that can appear anywhere in the number.   
Ex) 98.6, 0.0001, or -55.667.   

A **double** variable stores a floating-point number, declares a double variable.   
Ex) double milesTravel;   

A **floating-point literal** is a number with a fractional part, even if the fraction is 0, as in 1.0, 0.0, or 99.573.   
Good practice is to always have a digit before the decimal point, as in 0.5.   
scanf and printf use **%lf** to specify a double type in the string literal, in contrast to %d for an int type. 
```c
int main(void) {
  double milesTravel; // User input of miles to travel
  double hoursFly;    // Travel hours if flying those miles
  double hoursDrive;  // Travel hours if driving those miles
   
  printf("Enter miles to travel:\n");
  scanf("%lf", &milesTravel);
   
  hoursFly   = milesTravel / 500.0; // Plane flies 500 mph
  hoursDrive = milesTravel / 60.0;  // Car drives 60 mph
   
  printf("%lf miles would take:\n", milesTravel);
  printf("   %lf hours to fly\n", hoursFly);
  printf("   %lf hours to drive\n", hoursDrive);

  return 0;
}
```

## Choosing a variable type (double vs. int)
A programmer should choose a variable's type based on the type of value held.   
* Integer variables are typically used for values that are counted, like 42 cars, 10 pizzas, or -95 days.
* Floating-point variables are typically used for measurements, like 98.6 degrees, 0.00001 meters, or -55.667 degrees.
* Floating-point variables are also used when dealing with fractions of countable items, such as the average number of cars per household.

## Floating-point division by zero
Dividing a nonzero floating-point number by zero is undefined in regular arithmetic.   
Many programming languages produce an error when performing floating-point division by 0, **but C does not**.   
C handles this operation by producing infinity or -infinity, depending on the signs of the operands.   
If the dividend and divisor in floating-point division are both 0, the division results in a **"not a number"**.    
**Not a number (NaN)** indicates an unrepresentable or undefined value.   
```c
int main(void) {
  double gasVolume;
  double oilVolume;
  double mixRatio;
   
  printf("Enter gas volume: ");
  scanf("%lf", &gasVolume);

  printf("Enter oil volume: ");
  scanf("%lf", &oilVolume);

  mixRatio = gasVolume / oilVolume;
   
  printf("Gas to oil mix ratio is %lf:1\n", mixRatio);
   
  return 0;
  // result : Enter gas volume: 10.5
  // Enter oil volume: 0.0
  // Gas to oil mix ration is inf:1
}
```

## Manipulating floating-point output
Some floating-point numbers have many digits after the decimal point.   
Ex) Irrational numbers (3.14159265359...) have an infinite number of digits after the decimal.   
Ex) Repeating decimals (4.33333333...) have an infinite number of digits after the decimal.   

By default, most programming languages output at least 5 digits after the decimal point.   
But for many simple programs, this level of detail is not necessary.   

The syntax for outputting the double myFloat with two digits after the decimal point is **printf("%.2lf", myFloat);**   
When outputting a certain number of digits after the decimal using printf(), C rounds the last output digit.   
However, the floating-point value remains the same.   
```c
printf("Default output of pi: %lf\n",  M_PI);
// result: Default output of pi: 3.141593

printf("pi reduced to 4 digits after the decimal: ");
printf("%.4lf\n", M_PI);
// result: pi reduced to 4 digits after the decimal: 3.1416
```
```c
int main(void) {
  double sphereVolume;
  double sphereRadius;

  scanf("%lf", &sphereRadius);

  sphereVolume = (4.0/3.0) * M_PI * sphereRadius * sphereRadius * sphereRadius;

  printf("%.2lf\n", sphereVolume);

  return 0;
}
```

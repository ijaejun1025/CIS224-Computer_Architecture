# 12.07 Floating-point numbers (double)

## Floating-point (double) variables
A **floating-point number** is a real number containing a decimal point that can appear anywhere in the number.   
Ex) 98.6, 0.0001, or -55.667.   

A **double** variable stores a floating-point number, declares a double variable.   
Ex) double milesTravel;   

A **floating-point literal** is a number with a fractional part, even if the fraction is 0, as in 1.0, 0.0, or 99.573.   
Good practice is to always have a digit before the decimal point, as in 0.5.   
scanf and printf use **%lf** to specify a double type in the string literal, in contrast to %d for an int type.

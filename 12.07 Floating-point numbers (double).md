# 12.07 Floating-point numbers (double)

## Floating-point (double) variables
A **floating-point number** is a real number containing a decimal point that can appear anywhere in the number.   
Ex) 98.6, 0.0001, or -55.667.   

A **double** variable stores a floating-point number, declares a double variable.   
Ex) double milesTravel;   

A **floating-point literal** is a number with a fractional part, even if the fraction is 0, as in 1.0, 0.0, or 99.573.   
Good practice is to always have a digit before the decimal point, as in 0.5.   
scanf and printf use **%lf** to specify a double type in the string literal, in contrast to %d for an int type. 
```c
int main(void) {
  double milesTravel; // User input of miles to travel
  double hoursFly;    // Travel hours if flying those miles
  double hoursDrive;  // Travel hours if driving those miles
   
  printf("Enter miles to travel:\n");
  scanf("%lf", &milesTravel);
   
  hoursFly   = milesTravel / 500.0; // Plane flies 500 mph
  hoursDrive = milesTravel / 60.0;  // Car drives 60 mph
   
  printf("%lf miles would take:\n", milesTravel);
  printf("   %lf hours to fly\n", hoursFly);
  printf("   %lf hours to drive\n", hoursDrive);

  return 0;
}
```

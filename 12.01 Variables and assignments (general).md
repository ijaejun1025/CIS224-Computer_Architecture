# 12.1 Variables and assignments (general)

## Variables and assignments
In a program, a **variable** is a named item, such as x or numPeople, used to hold a value.   
An **assignment** assigns a variable with a value, such as x = 5.   
That assignment means x is assigned with 5, and x keeps that value until x is assigned again.   
An assignment's **left side** must be a variable.   
The **right side** can be an expression.

## = is not equals
In programming, **= is an assignment** of a left-side variable with a right-side value.   
= is NOT equality as in mathematics.   
Thus, x = 5 is read as "x is assigned with 5", and not as "x equals 5".

## Assignments with variable on left and right
Because in programming = means assignment, a variable may appear on both the left and right as in x = x + 1.   
If x was originally 6, x is assigned with 6 + 1, or 7.   
The assignment overwrites the original 6 in x.   
Increasing a variable's value by 1, as in x = x + 1, is common, and known as **incrementing** the variable.

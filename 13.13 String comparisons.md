# 13.13 String comparisons

## String comparison: Equality
A programmer can compare two strings using: ``strcmp(str1, str2) == 0``.   
The **strcmp** function **returns 0** if the strings are equal, and some non-zero value otherwise.   
The programmer must add  ``#include <string.h>`` to use strcmp.   

1. A common error is **to omit the == 0** from strcmp(str1, str2) == 0 when comparing for equality.   
2. Another common error is to compare two strings using **str1 == str2**, which behaves differently than expected.

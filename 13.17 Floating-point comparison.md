# 13.17 Floating-point comparison

Floating-point numbers should not be compared using ==.   
Ex: Avoid float1 == float2.   

Reason: Some floating-point numbers cannot be exactly represented in the limited available memory bits like 64 bits.   
Floating-point numbers expected to be equal may be close but not exactly equal.   

Floating-point numbers should be compared for "close enough" rather than exact equality.   
Ex: If (x - y) < 0.0001, x and y are deemed equal.   
Because the difference may be negative, the absolute value is used: fabs(x - y) < 0.0001.   
``fabs()`` is a function in the math library. => ``fabs`` is for float, ``abs`` is for integer   

The difference threshold indicating that floating-point numbers are equal is often called the **epsilon**.   
Epsilon's value depends on the program's expected values, but 0.0001 is common.   

## Example of comparing floating-point numbers for equality: Body temperature
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(void) {
   double bodyTemp;
   
   printf("Enter body temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
   scanf("%lf", &bodyTemp);
   
   if (fabs(bodyTemp - 98.6) < 0.0001) {
      printf("Temperature is exactly normal.\n");
   }
   else if (bodyTemp > 98.6) {
      printf("Temperature is above normal.\n");
   }
   else {
      printf("Temperature is below normal.\n");
   }
   
   return 0;
}

/*
  Enter body temperature in Fahrenheit: 98.6
  Temperature is exactly normal.

  Enter body temperature in Fahrenheit: 90
  Temperature is below normal.

  Enter body temperature in Fahrenheit: 99
  Temperature is above normal.
*/
```

## Observing the inexact values stored in floating-point variables
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   double sampleValue1 = 0.2;
   double sampleValue2 = 0.3;
   double sampleValue3 = 0.7;
   double sampleValue4 = 0.0;
   double sampleValue5 = 0.25;
   
   printf("samplevalue1 using just %%lf: %lf\n", 
          sampleValue1);

   printf("sampleValue1 is %.25lf\n", sampleValue1);
   printf("sampleValue2 is %.25lf\n", sampleValue2);
   printf("sampleValue3 is %.25lf\n", sampleValue3);
   printf("sampleValue4 is %.25lf\n", sampleValue4);
   printf("sampleValue5 is %.25lf\n", sampleValue5);
   
   return 0;
}

/*
   samplevalue1 using just %lf: 0.200000
   sampleValue1 is 0.2000000000000000111022302
   sampleValue2 is 0.2999999999999999888977698
   sampleValue3 is 0.6999999999999999555910790
   sampleValue4 is 0.0000000000000000000000000
   sampleValue5 is 0.2500000000000000000000000

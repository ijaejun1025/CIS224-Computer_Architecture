# 12.23 C example: Salary calculation with variables

Using variables in expressions makes a program more general and makes expressions more meaningful.   

```c
// Calculate salary: Generalize a program with variables and input.

// The following program uses a variable workHoursPerWeek rather than directly using 40 in the salary calculation expression.
// 1. Run the program, observe the output. Change 40 to 35 (France's work week), and run again.
// 2. Generalize the program further by using a variable workWeeksPerYear. Run the program. Change 50 to 52, and run again.
// 3. Introduce a variable monthlySalary, used similarly to annualSalary, to further improve program readability.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int hourlyWage;
   int workHoursPerWeek;
   int annualSalary;
   int monthlySalary;
   int workWeeksPerYear = 52;

   // TODO: Declare and initialize variable workWeeksPerYear, then replace the 50's below

   hourlyWage = 20;
   workHoursPerWeek = 35;

   annualSalary = hourlyWage * workHoursPerWeek * workWeeksPerYear;
   printf("Annual salary is: ");
   printf("%d\n", annualSalary);

   monthlySalary = (hourlyWage * workHoursPerWeek * workWeeksPerYear) / 12;
   printf("Monthly salary is: ");
   printf("%d\n", monthlySalary);

   return 0;
}
```

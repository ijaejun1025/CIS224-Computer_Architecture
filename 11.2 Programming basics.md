# 11.2 Programming basics

## A first program
```c
int main(void) { // A program begins executing statements in main().
  int wage; // Each statement typically ends with a semicolon.

  wage = 20;

  printf("Salary is ");
  printf("%d", wage * 40 * 52);
  printf("\n");

  return 0; // 'return 0' statement ends the program.
}
```

## Basic input
Programs commonly get input values, perform some processing on that input, and put output values to a screen or elsewhere.   
The following statement gets an input value and puts the value into variable x: **scanf ("%d", &x)**   
```c
int main(void) {
  int wage;

  scanf("%d", &wage);
  // The scanf function is used to store values entered from the keyboard in a variable.
  // The scanf statement gets an input value from the keyboard and puts that value into the wage variable.

  printf("Salary is ");
  printf("%d\n", wage * 40 * 52);

  return 0;
}
```

```c
int main(void) {
  int dogYears;
  int humanYears;

  scanf("%d", &dogYears);
  // The scanf statement gets an input value from the keyboard and puts that value into the dogYears variable.
  humanYears = 7 * dogYears;

  printf("%d", dogYears);
  printf(" dog years is about ");
  printf("%d", humanYears);
  printf(" human years.\n");

  return 0;
}
```

## Basic output: Text
The **printf** construct supports output.   
Outputting text is achieved via: **printf("desired text");**   
Text in double quotes " " is known as a **string literal**.   
Multiple printf statements continue printing on the same output line.   
A **newline** character, **\n**, in the string literal starts a new output line, called a newline.

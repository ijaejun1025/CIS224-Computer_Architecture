# 13.04 Detecting ranges with branches

## Relational operators
A **relational operator** checks how one operand's value relates to another, like being greater than.

Some operators, like >=, involve two characters.   
A programmer cannot arbitrarily combine the >, =, and < symbols; only the shown two-character sequences represent valid operators.

## Detecting ranges with if-else statements
Programmers commonly use the sequential nature of the multi-branch if-else arrangement to detect ranges of numbers.   
In the following example, the second branch expression is only reached if the first expression is false.   
So the second branch is taken if userAge < 16 is false (so 16 or greater) AND userAge is < 25, meaning userAge is between 16 - 24.

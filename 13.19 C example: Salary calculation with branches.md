# 13.19 C example: Salary calculation with branches

## Calculate salary: Calculate overtime using branches
The following program calculates weekly salary and assumes work-hours-per-week limit of 40.   
Overtime refers to hours worked per week in excess of some weekly limit, such as 40 hours.   
Some companies pay time-and-a-half for overtime hours, meaning overtime hours are paid at 1.5 times the hourly wage.   

## Calculate salary: Calculate overtime using branches - Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int hourlyWage;
   int weeklyHours;
   int weeklySalary;
   int overtimeHours;
   const int WEEKLY_LIMIT = 40;

   printf("Enter hourly wage: \n");
   scanf("%d", &hourlyWage);

   // FIXME: Get user input value for weeklyHours
   weeklyHours = 40;


   if (weeklyHours <= WEEKLY_LIMIT) {
      weeklySalary = weeklyHours * hourlyWage;
   }
   else {
      overtimeHours = weeklyHours - WEEKLY_LIMIT;
      weeklySalary = (int)((hourlyWage * WEEKLY_LIMIT) +
                           (hourlyWage * overtimeHours * 1.5));
   }
   
   printf("Weekly salary is: %d\n", weeklySalary);

   return 0;
}
```

## Determine tax rate
Income tax is calculated based on annual income.   
The tax rate is determined with a tiered approach: Income above a particular tier level is taxed at that level's rate.

1. Run the program with an annual income of 120000. Note the tax rate and tax to pay.
2. Modify the program to add a new tier: Annual income above 50000 but less than or equal to 100000 is taxed at the rate of 30%, and annual income above 100000 is taxed at 40%.
3. Run the program again with an annual income of 120000. What is the tax rate and tax to pay now?
4. Run the program again with an annual income of 60000. (Change the input area below the program.)
5. Challenge: What happens if a negative annual salary is entered? Modify the program to print an error message in that case.

## Determine tax rate - Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   int annualSalary;
   double taxRate;
   int taxToPay;

   printf("Enter annual salary: \n");
   scanf("%d", &annualSalary);

   // Determine the tax rate from the annual salary
   // FIXME: Write code to address the challenge question above
   if ((annualSalary > 50000) && (annualSalary <= 100000)) {
      taxRate = 0.30;
   }
   else if (annualSalary >= 100000) {
      taxRate = 0.40;
   }
   // FIXME: Add tier
   else if (annualSalary < 0){
      printf("Error\n");
      exit(0);
   }

   taxToPay = (int)(annualSalary * taxRate);     // Truncate tax to an integer amount

   printf("Annual Salary: %d\n", annualSalary);
   printf("Tax rate: %lf\n", taxRate);
   printf("Tax to pay: %d\n", taxToPay);

   return 0;
}
```

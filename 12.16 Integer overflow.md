# 12.16 Integer overflow

An integer variable cannot store a number larger than the maximum supported by the variable's data type.   
An **overflow** occurs when the value being assigned to a variable is greater than the maximum value the variable can store.   

Ex) ``int hrsUploadedTotal;`` -> int type can have maximum 32 bits   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``hrsUploadedTotal = 4294967297;`` -> assign 33 bits to int type -> 100000000000000000000000000000001 in binary   
    However, because int type only can have 32 bits -> can only store 00000000000000000000000000000001 in binary   
    The 33rd bit (1) is lost and only the lower 32 bits are stored, namely 00000000000000000000000000000001, which is decimal number 1.

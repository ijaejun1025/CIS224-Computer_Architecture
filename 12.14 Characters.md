# 12.14 Characters

## Basics
A variable of **char** type, as in ``char myChar;``, can store a single character like the letter m.   
A character literal is surrounded with single quotes, as in ``myChar = 'm';``.   
printf uses **%c** to specify a char item, as in ``printf("%c", myChar);``.   

```c
// Simple char example: Arrow

#include <studio.h>

int main(void) {
  char arrowBody;
  char arrowHead;

  arrowBody = '-';
  arrowHead = '>';

  printf("%c%c%c%c\n", arrowBody, arrowBody, arrowBody, arrowHead);

  arrowBody = 'o';

  printf("%c%c%c%c\n", arrowBody, arrowBody, arrowBody, arrowHead);

  return 0;
  // result : --->
              ooo>
}
```

## Getting a character from input
scanf uses %c to get one character from input.   
A space before the %c causes scanf to ignore leading whitespace.   
As for integers, the variable name must be preceded by &. Ex: ``scanf(" %c", &myChar);``

# 12.12 Type conversions

## Type conversions
A **type conversion** is a conversion of one data type to another, such as an int to a double.   
The compiler automatically performs several common conversions between int and double types, are known as **implicit conversion**.   
For an arithmetic operator like + or *, if either operand is a double, the other is automatically converted to double.   
* int-to-double conversion is straightforward: 25 becomes 25.0.
* double-to-int conversion just drops the fraction: 4.9 becomes 4.

## Type casting
A programmer sometimes needs to explicitly convert an item's type.   
A **type cast** explicitly converts a value of one type to another type.   
A programmer can precede an expression with **(type)** to convert the expression's value to the indicated type.   
Ex) If myIntVar is 7, then (double)myIntVar converts int 7 to double 7.0.   
```c
// Using type casting to obtain floating-point division.

int main(void) {
  int kidsInFamily1;       // Should be int, not double
  int kidsInFamily2;       // (know anyone with 2.3 kids?)
  int numFamilies; 

  double avgKidsPerFamily; // Expect fraction, so double

  kidsInFamily1 = 3;
  kidsInFamily2 = 4;
  numFamilies = 2; 

  avgKidsPerFamily = (double)(kidsInFamily1 + kidsInFamily2) / (double)numFamilies;

  printf("Average kids per family: %lf\n", avgKidsPerFamily);

  return 0;
  // result: Average kids per family: 3.5
}
```

## Common errors
A common error is to accidentally perform integer division when floating-point division was intended.   
The program below undesirably performs integer division rather than floating-point division.   
```c
// Common error: Forgetting cast results in integer division.

int main(void) {
  int kidsInFamily1;       // Should be int, not double
  int kidsInFamily2;       // (know anyone with 2.3 kids?)
  int numFamilies; 

  double avgKidsPerFamily; // Expect fraction, so double

  kidsInFamily1 = 3;
  kidsInFamily2 = 4;
  numFamilies = 2; 

  avgKidsPerFamily = (kidsInFamily1 + kidsInFamily2) / numFamilies;

  // Should be 3.5, but is 3 instead
  printf("Average kids per family: %lf\n", avgKidsPerFamily);

  return 0;
  // result: Average kids per family: 3
}
```

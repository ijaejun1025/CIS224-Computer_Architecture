# 12.12 Type conversions

## Type conversions
A **type conversion** is a conversion of one data type to another, such as an int to a double.   
The compiler automatically performs several common conversions between int and double types, are known as **implicit conversion**.   
For an arithmetic operator like + or *, if either operand is a double, the other is automatically converted to double.   
* int-to-double conversion is straightforward: 25 becomes 25.0.
* double-to-int conversion just drops the fraction: 4.9 becomes 4.

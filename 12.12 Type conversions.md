# 12.12 Type conversions

## Type conversions
A **type conversion** is a conversion of one data type to another, such as an int to a double.   
The compiler automatically performs several common conversions between int and double types, are known as **implicit conversion**.   
For an arithmetic operator like + or *, if either operand is a double, the other is automatically converted to double.   
```c
// Implicit type conversion: int-to-double.

expectedMales = 0.504 * numBirths;
// Compiler automatically performs int-to-double conversion
// 0.504 (double) * 316 (int)
// 0.504 (double) * 316.0 (double)
// 159.264 (double)
```
